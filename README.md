## Idea:
Neo which is also an anagram for one (and yes! it's also the name of the main character from the matrix trilogy) is an attempt to create a platform that provides a single identity for every individual and also holds various other ids of the owner. The owner can use this Digital Id in the following ways:-
  
  1.Use the verified ids already present over the blockchain to apply for new ids. For example: Using Aadhaar card for Address proof and class 10th certificate for Age proof already present on the platform to apply for PAN card. This all can be done just by sharing DigiId to the attester of PAN card.
  
  2.Share or Show his Identity to someone and since once the data is on this platform it will automatically imply that it's been verified from a credible body (Government).
  
  3.Platform eliminates the need for various documents as it integrates all of them into a single Digital application.
### Profile Section:
This section will only be accessible by the owner of the DigiId. Here, they can view all of their different ids at one place and also, it will provide an upload section for scanned documents which will not need verification but the owner will be able to put it there for sharing purposes. For example: Medical records which the owner can share with a doctor over blockchain.
